Big Boss Advergame
This is a game like a Google banner – it looks like an ad (with an event name and dates and
location) but when you click on it, it turns to be minimalistic interactive game.
The purpose of this game is to advertise DLG public events like final thesis defence or presentation
of other study results (e.g. exam of the Computer Games course).
10? students (NPC’s) try to enter to the TLÜ (Terra or Astra building) - in the first round (level 1)
they walk in a row like lemmings.
Teacher (a monster on the roof of the university building) tries to stop students by spitting fire balls
on them. The size and the damage of the fireball depends on the delay time (the more frequently the
monster is spitting the smaller the fireball is - destroys only one student).
Students who get a hit will run away (they don’t die)
If all students get in, the game is over and player will get the feedback
